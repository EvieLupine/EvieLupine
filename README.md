### **Hi there my name is Evie. ğŸ‘‹**
## *This is my portfolio and information about me.*
# I am a student at Western Springs Collage and I am a new student there. I am from England and have lived there for many years but have also lived in other places round the world. I spend most of my time at home with my family and dog. A lot of my free time is used drawing digitally on my device mmy specialty is drawing wolves. In the past I have had an art exhibition in Taranaki at a place called The Collaboration. Most of my life I have worked to better my artwork in more detail and to create my own unique style. I have P.H.A.C.E.S Syndrome and Autism. Werewolves and all things nature make me very happy along with music which I sometimes listent to.
