## **Hi there my name is Evie. ðŸ‘‹**
## *This is my portfolio and some information about me.*
### I am a student at Western Springs Collage and I am a new student there. I am from England and have lived there for many years but have also lived in other places round the world. I spend most of my time at home with my family and dog. A lot of my free time is used drawing digitally on my device, my specialty is drawing wolves. In the past I have had an art exhibition in Taranaki at a place called The Collaboration. Most of my life I have worked to better my artwork in more detail and to create my own unique style. I have P.H.A.C.E.S Syndrome and Autism. Werewolves and all things nature make me very happy along with music which I sometimes listent to. My calm space is whem I am drawing it makes me really content and happy it also keeps my focus off anxiety.
> In the past I have digitally created
1. I used to do a lot of mixed media online with photoshop with a mix of my artwork to create a unique style.
2. Digtial art that is mainly posted to my friends to see aand rarely my instagram but still a big interest of mine I persue in.
3. At one point a lot of video editing was of best interest to me but I did not have sources of good quality to really allow me to continue to create that.
### Why Digital Technology? Of recent years VR and playing some video games from time to time have been of great fun to me, I have talked and made many connections online with friends from around the world. VRChat is a game I really enjoy and it opens a world of fun and creativity to me, to see many characters and identity of people that are displayed through characters really inspire me. I hope that Digital Technology helps me to learn how to create art in this complex and unique way so that I may play a game in the shoes of my character. Technology has also beeen something my dad is very interested in and he does coding too and so I aspire to aquire that knowledge one day so that I no longer need help when it comes to computer issues, I wish to gain independance.
### I am not very familiar at all with any Digital Languages when it comes to coding this is a first for me. But so far I am aware of the term Markup and Markdown language. 
### One day I think it would be really cool if I could create a business that I could take commisions from people who wish to have their character for VR come to life. And maybe even a scary werewolf horror game would be cool, I don't see many werewolf games out there.
